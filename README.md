## 👋 About Me

I'm **G. Madavan**, a Computer Science student at **SRM IST**, passionate about building meaningful tech that solves real-world problems.  
I love working with **AI/ML, Cloud (AWS/OCI)**, and **DevOps**, and I enjoy crafting smart solutions — from assistive robots to disease prediction systems.

I'm hands-on, curious, and always learning.  
Whether it's coding, deploying, or experimenting with new tech, I believe in **turning ideas into impact**.

> 💡 “Technology should not just be smart — it should be kind.”
